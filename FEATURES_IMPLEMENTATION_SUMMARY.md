# Features Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the implementation and testing of the three requested features for the e-commerce API.

## ‚úÖ IMPLEMENTED FEATURES

### 1. GET /profile Route ‚úÖ **FULLY WORKING**

**Implementation:**

- Route: `GET /profile`
- Authentication: Required (JWT token)
- Controller: `src/controllers/profileController.js`
- Middleware: `src/middleware/auth.js`

**Functionality:**

- ‚úÖ Returns user profile for both customers and admins
- ‚úÖ Excludes password field from response
- ‚úÖ Role-based access (customers see their profile, admins see their profile)
- ‚úÖ Proper authentication required
- ‚úÖ Returns 401 for unauthorized access

**Response Format:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Profile retrieved successfully",
  "data": {
    "_id": "user_id",
    "fullName": "User Name",
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "role": "customer|admin",
    "createdAt": "timestamp",
    "updatedAt": "timestamp"
  }
}
```

**Testing:**

- ‚úÖ Customer profile access working
- ‚úÖ Admin profile access working
- ‚úÖ Password exclusion working
- ‚úÖ Unauthorized access properly blocked
- ‚úÖ Added to Postman collection v2

### 2. GET /order-history with Role-based Filtering ‚úÖ **FULLY WORKING**

**Implementation:**

- Route: `GET /order-history`
- Authentication: Required (JWT token)
- Controller: `src/controllers/orderController.js` (getOrderHistory function)
- Role-based filtering implemented

**Functionality:**

- ‚úÖ **Customers**: Only see their own orders
- ‚úÖ **Admins**: See all orders in the system
- ‚úÖ Pagination support (`?page=1&limit=10`)
- ‚úÖ Status filtering (`?status=pending|shipped|delivered`)
- ‚úÖ Proper authentication required
- ‚úÖ Returns 401 for unauthorized access

**Response Format:**

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "message": "Order history retrieved successfully",
  "data": {
    "orders": [
      {
        "_id": "order_id",
        "orderNumber": "ORD-123456",
        "customerId": "customer_id",
        "items": [...],
        "totalAmount": 100.00,
        "shippingStatus": "pending|shipped|delivered",
        "createdAt": "timestamp"
      }
    ],
    "pagination": {
      "currentPage": 1,
      "totalPages": 5,
      "totalOrders": 50,
      "hasNextPage": true,
      "hasPrevPage": false
    }
  }
}
```

**Role-based Filtering Logic:**

```javascript
// Customer query - only their orders
if (userRole === "customer") {
  query.customerId = userId;
}
// Admin query - all orders (no filter)
```

**Testing:**

- ‚úÖ Customer role filtering working (only sees own orders)
- ‚úÖ Admin role filtering working (sees all orders)
- ‚úÖ Pagination working correctly
- ‚úÖ Unauthorized access properly blocked
- ‚úÖ Added to Postman collection v2

---

### 3. Socket.io Notifications ‚ö†Ô∏è **PARTIALLY WORKING**

**Implementation:**

- Socket service: `src/services/socketService.js`
- Integration: Order status updates trigger notifications
- Authentication: JWT token required for socket connection

**Functionality:**

- ‚úÖ Socket.io server initialized
- ‚úÖ Socket authentication middleware implemented
- ‚úÖ User room joining (`user_${userId}`)
- ‚úÖ Notification format matches requirements
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Issue**: Notifications not being received by clients

**Required Notification Format:**

```json
{
  "title": "New shipping status",
  "message": "Your last order shipping status has been updated to shipped"
}
```

**Implementation Details:**

- Socket rooms: `user_${customerId}`
- Trigger: When admin updates order status via `PUT /orders/:id/status`
- Target: Only the customer who owns the order receives notification

**Current Status:**

- Socket connections working
- Authentication working
- Room joining working
- Notification sending implemented
- **Issue**: Client not receiving notifications (needs debugging)
