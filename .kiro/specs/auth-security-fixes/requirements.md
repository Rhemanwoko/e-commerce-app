# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses critical security vulnerabilities in the ecommerce API authentication system. The current implementation allows unauthorized access to protected endpoints (product creation and deletion) due to missing environment configuration validation, insufficient error handling, and lack of proper authentication flow verification. This feature will implement comprehensive security measures to ensure only authenticated admin users can perform privileged operations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the API to validate all required environment variables on startup, so that authentication failures are caught early and the system doesn't run in an insecure state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server starts THEN the system SHALL validate that JWT_SECRET is present and meets minimum security requirements (32+ characters)
2. WHEN JWT_SECRET is missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL log a critical error and exit with a non-zero status code
3. WHEN all required environment variables are valid THEN the system SHALL log a confirmation message and continue startup
4. WHEN NODE_ENV is not set THEN the system SHALL default to 'development' and log a warning

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security-conscious developer, I want comprehensive error handling and logging for authentication failures, so that I can monitor and debug security issues effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an authentication middleware encounters an error THEN the system SHALL log the error details with appropriate severity level
2. WHEN a JWT token is invalid or expired THEN the system SHALL return a standardized error response with specific error codes
3. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL NOT expose sensitive information in error messages
4. WHEN multiple authentication attempts fail THEN the system SHALL log security warnings for monitoring

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an API consumer, I want clear and consistent error responses for authentication failures, so that I can handle errors appropriately in my client application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN no Authorization header is provided THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 401 with error code 'NO_TOKEN'
2. WHEN an invalid token format is provided THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 401 with error code 'INVALID_TOKEN_FORMAT'
3. WHEN a token is expired THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 401 with error code 'TOKEN_EXPIRED'
4. WHEN a user is not found THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 401 with error code 'USER_NOT_FOUND'
5. WHEN a user lacks required permissions THEN the system SHALL return HTTP 403 with error code 'INSUFFICIENT_PERMISSIONS'

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer testing the API, I want a comprehensive test suite that validates authentication security, so that I can ensure the system is properly secured before deployment.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN running security tests THEN the system SHALL verify that protected endpoints reject requests without tokens
2. WHEN testing with invalid tokens THEN the system SHALL verify appropriate error responses are returned
3. WHEN testing with expired tokens THEN the system SHALL verify access is denied
4. WHEN testing with non-admin users THEN the system SHALL verify admin-only endpoints are protected
5. WHEN all security tests pass THEN the system SHALL confirm authentication is working correctly

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want startup validation and health checks that verify authentication system integrity, so that I can ensure the system is secure before handling requests.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server starts THEN the system SHALL perform a self-test of JWT token generation and verification
2. WHEN database connectivity is established THEN the system SHALL verify user model operations work correctly
3. WHEN all startup checks pass THEN the system SHALL set a ready state flag
4. WHEN health check endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL include authentication system status in the response
5. WHEN any critical component fails startup validation THEN the system SHALL prevent the server from accepting requests
