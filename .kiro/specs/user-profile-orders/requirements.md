# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature adds user profile management, order history functionality, and real-time notifications to the existing e-commerce API. Users will be able to view their profile information, access their order history with role-based permissions, and receive real-time notifications when order shipping status changes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a customer or admin, I want to view my profile information, so that I can see my account details and verify my information is correct.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user makes a GET request to /profile with valid authentication THEN the system SHALL return their profile information
2. WHEN a customer accesses /profile THEN the system SHALL return their user data excluding sensitive information like password
3. WHEN an admin accesses /profile THEN the system SHALL return their admin profile data
4. IF a user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL return a 401 unauthorized error
5. WHEN the profile is retrieved successfully THEN the system SHALL return a 200 status code with user data

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to view my order history, so that I can track my past purchases and their status.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a customer makes a GET request to /order-history with valid authentication THEN the system SHALL return only orders they have made
2. WHEN a customer accesses /order-history THEN the system SHALL filter results to show only their own orders
3. IF a customer tries to access orders they didn't make THEN the system SHALL not include those orders in the response
4. WHEN order history is retrieved successfully THEN the system SHALL return a 200 status code with the customer's orders
5. IF a customer has no orders THEN the system SHALL return an empty array with 200 status code

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As an admin, I want to view all order history, so that I can manage and monitor all orders in the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin makes a GET request to /order-history with valid authentication THEN the system SHALL return all orders in the system
2. WHEN an admin accesses /order-history THEN the system SHALL not filter results and show all customer orders
3. WHEN admin order history is retrieved successfully THEN the system SHALL return a 200 status code with all orders
4. IF an admin has insufficient permissions THEN the system SHALL return a 403 forbidden error

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a customer, I want to receive real-time notifications when my order shipping status changes, so that I can stay informed about my order progress.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an admin updates an order's shipping status THEN the system SHALL emit a real-time notification to the customer who made that order
2. WHEN a shipping status notification is sent THEN the system SHALL use the format: {title: "New shipping status", message: "Your last order shipping status has been updated to <updated-shipping-status>"}
3. WHEN a customer is connected via socket.io THEN the system SHALL deliver the notification in real-time
4. IF a customer is not connected THEN the system SHALL still update the order but not fail the status update operation
5. WHEN multiple customers have orders THEN the system SHALL only notify the specific customer whose order was updated

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want proper authentication and authorization for all new endpoints, so that user data remains secure and access is properly controlled.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any user accesses /profile or /order-history without authentication THEN the system SHALL return a 401 unauthorized error
2. WHEN a user provides invalid authentication tokens THEN the system SHALL return a 401 unauthorized error
3. WHEN role-based access is required THEN the system SHALL verify user roles before granting access
4. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL not expose any user data or order information
5. WHEN proper authentication is provided THEN the system SHALL process the request according to user role permissions
