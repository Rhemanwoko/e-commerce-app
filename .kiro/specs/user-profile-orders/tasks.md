- [x] 3. Create order history route endpoint

  - Add GET /order-history route to existing order routes
  - Wire the new getOrderHistory controller method to the route
  - Ensure proper authentication middleware is applied
  - Test route integration with existing order routing structure
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 3.1, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_

- [x] 4. Implement socket.io notification system for order updates

  - Enhance existing order update functionality to emit socket notifications
  - Implement customer-specific notification targeting using customerId
  - Add notification format validation with required title and message structure
  - Ensure graceful handling when customers are not connected to socket
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5_

- [x] 5. Create comprehensive unit tests for profile functionality

  - Write unit tests for profile controller getProfile method
  - Test authentication requirement and error handling
  - Test password exclusion from profile response
  - Test profile retrieval for different user roles
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.5, 5.4_

- [x] 6. Create comprehensive unit tests for order history functionality

  - Write unit tests for order history controller method
  - Test role-based filtering logic (customer vs admin access)
  - Test authentication requirements and error scenarios
  - Test empty order history handling
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4, 2.5, 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 5.4_

- [x] 7. Create integration tests for new endpoints

  - Write integration tests for GET /profile endpoint
  - Write integration tests for GET /order-history endpoint with role-based scenarios
  - Test complete request/response cycles including authentication
  - Test error scenarios and proper HTTP status codes
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 1.5, 2.1, 2.4, 2.5, 3.1, 3.4, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3_

- [x] 8. Create integration tests for socket.io notifications

  - Write tests for order update triggering socket notifications
  - Test customer-specific notification targeting
  - Test notification format and content validation
  - Test graceful handling of disconnected clients
  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5_

- [x] 9. Update application routing to include new profile routes

  - Import and register profile routes in main app.js
  - Ensure proper route ordering and middleware application
  - Test that new routes are accessible and properly integrated
  - Verify no conflicts with existing route patterns
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 5.1, 5.2_

- [x] 10. Create end-to-end test script for complete feature validation

  - Write comprehensive test script that validates all new functionality
  - Test profile retrieval for different user types
  - Test order history with role-based filtering
  - Test real-time notifications when order status changes
  - Include authentication scenarios and error handling validation
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.4, 1.5, 2.1, 2.4, 2.5, 3.1, 3.4, 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4_
